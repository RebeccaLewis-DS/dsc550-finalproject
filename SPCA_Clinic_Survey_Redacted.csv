Last time this happened with my TNR animal I was informed before the procedure and the animal was humanly euthanized.  This time I was not informed and the procedure was done and then when the cat was received I decided to put him down since he was feral and not able to give medication.  The second feral cat exhibits the same symptoms and is mean and a fighter so I have decided to euthanize him instead of putting him thru the trapping shipping and procedure to be awaken and sent back to be euthanized.

Was charged $40 additional at the end of the procedure. Received my pet with his hindquarters literally covered in feces. He obviously defecated during the procedure and all that was done was to smear it around. The incisions for his procedure are not well made and the sutures look like they were done by someone who failed out of their first year of medical school. 100% will recommend to others to avoid this location.

Anyway, I sent my son with the cat and I asked that he have the cat treated for fleas as well since we would try to make this an outside cat. The cost was more than $35 plus flea meds? I actually paid $35 for the spay/neuter and an additional $35 for a feral cat vaccination package. I did get a flea treatment for only $5 which was great.   So, why did you charge more than what was quoted?    This kitten is darling and we are all in love with it. I do feel like a bait and switch of sorts has taken place:-)"

Another $97 was added because the vet had to use mite cleaning solution in their ears even though neither of them had mites, according to the tech that released my cats to me. Furthermore, I have given this place a great recommendation for doing such a great job with my other two cats spay/neuter procedures. I will no longer be doing so. I felt that I deserved better service. For all the money I ended up forking over, the least they could have done was give us a couple of cat beds like last time I visited, instead of urine soaked newspaper. I am so disappointed. My S/O and I finally found a facility that doesn‚Äôt rob your pocket book and all that changed on August 30th 2018. ASPCA had so much potential to do great things and be unlike the rest. Not so much anymore. I hope you guys do better next time. "

Again, just now, arriving home an angry Miles Kearney from his front door yelled, ‚ÄúWhen are you going to get rid of those cats? I hate them. They get into my garden, shit in my backyard (separated by a hurricane fence). If they get in my yard I will kill them‚Äù.  I responded I was not getting rid of them but they had been spayed or neutered. He responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Get rid of them. I hate them. Clean your house.‚Äù  With that he went into his house and I expect will report me.  He and Michael Baker, my realtor over 17 years ago live at 1330 Camp. I am at 1326 Camp.  I am the one who comes from work as a nurse at a home in Slidell to clean the drains on Camp and Melpomene and the drains on Coliseum by Coliseum Square.   I pick up all the people trash on Melpomene and the neutral ground and the corner lot they use for parking.  I have already buried a black cat I had spayed, found next to my fence on Melpomene near my parked Alfa Romeo Spyder.  My understanding is that Community cats are beneficial.  It is my understanding it is up to him to keep the cats out of his yard.  This year they have been away to France, New York, Houston, and recently Florida. Wonder who takes care of the garden.  Miles always has an angry affect with me. For years Michael was like a brother. We rarely talk except and passing. He remains friendly in passing.  I think if hungry, homeless cats. I take care of them I feed the wild birds, too. My yard has never been poisoned. I respect life in all of its forms.  "

But YOUR DVM had the audacity to charge us a HUNDRED dollars and she didn‚Äôt even clean or treat his wounds !!!!!  Honestly, my wife and I feel like this SPCA DVM was absolutely not knowledgeable about this animal and yet she still charged at least 3 times what she should have in our opinion because she openly and clearly didn‚Äôt admitted not knowing how to treat the animal other than suggesting us to go to another DVM ........ Totally unacceptable !!!! We should be refunded because she should have not agreed to evaluate / treat if she clearly did not know HOW.... and , remember she didn‚Äôt even treat his wounds !!!!!! This was a total Rip Off and an experience that we did not expect to receive at the LA SPCA .......I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that DVM to anyone and if we return with one of my other pets I will make sure that DVM does NOT get involved........ She had limited Knowledge but was quick with the CHARGING $$$. On the other hand , we were very content with Dr. Smith‚Äôs treatment measures for my Rottweiler and very fair charges .....My name is Wayne Celentano and my number is 504-427-5940, I would be glad to speak with someone from SPCA if they prefer to call me .
